# A/B Tests
 The goal is to analyze the results of an A/B test and figure out whether the new design of the ad affects the behavior of users in terms of responding to the BIO questionnaire.

I have added various Jupyter notebooks to this repository in order to understand and learn A/B testing techniques. I will either add a new dataset or use an existing one.
